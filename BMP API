Our Web API enables external applications to access our database of BPM and song keys. It allows developers to build programs using getsongbpm's data on mobile devices or other web services. All you need is a valid API key.

Introduction
Any application can access our API endpoints, but must first be registered with a valid email address. To register your application, fill in the form on the left (or top on mobiles) of this page.

Whether your project is under development, for private use, educational or commercial purposes, adding a backling to getsongbpm.com is mandatory. We have no way of getting around this restriction. We're sorry for the inconvenience, but there's been way too much abuse. The API is free, the only thing we ask in return is a link to support us. Thank you for your understanding.

Feel free to contact us if you have any question.
